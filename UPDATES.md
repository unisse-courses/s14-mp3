### **TODO**
1. AJAX
  - ajax per page (10 pages in total)
  - ajax per feature (14 features in total)

2. MONGOOSE
  - input code for js files in the "models" folder (4 files in total)
  - transfer dummy data into the "data" folder (4 files in total i think)

THEN im not sure if need MVC agad but the last thing to do is:

3. CSS ICONS (do this after all the db things)
  - fix logos
    - logos in index.hbs (guest icon & registered user account icon)
    - brand logo in navbar (fixed size so its not stretched)
  - look for default icon for account?
    - so that we dont need to go thru the hassle of doing validation for an image file
    - but then i just realized we might need file validation for the create/edit recipe post image so idk
