1. css files
  - i made two css files instead
    - styles_inside.css for the files that are after log-in
    - style_outside.css for the files that are before log-in
2. in main.hbs
  - body can be two types of classes depending if theyre inside or outside
  - for the navbar partial problem, we can use an #if statement hopefully
