### **UPDATES**
**[SAM] UPDATES FOR 03/23/2020 6:55pm**
1. css files
  - i made two css files instead
    - styles_inside.css for the files that are after log-in
    - style_outside.css for the files that are before log-in
2. in main.hbs
  - body can be two types of classes depending if theyre inside or outside
  - for the navbar partial problem, we can use an #if statement & hopefully it will work

---
### **TODO**
- main.hbs
  - finish statements that need helpers
- all the other files
  - decide which elements need helpers + if they need to be in index.js
- fix logos
  - logos in index.hbs (guest icon & registered user account icon)
  - brand logo in navbar (fixed size so its not stretched)
- look for default icon for account?
  - so that we dont need to go thru the hassle of doing validation for an image file
  - but then i just realized we might need file validation for the create/edit recipe post image so idk
