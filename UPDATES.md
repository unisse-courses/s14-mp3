### **UPDATES**
**[SAM] UPDATES FOR 03/17/2020 9:51pm**
1. i placed all the files in the hbs file structure
2. i deleted the old files in my terminal
3. all our html files became -> hbs files
   - i havent touched the new hbs files but i did make 2 files called "main.hbs" and "navbar.hbs"
   - main.hbs just has a copy paste of one of the html files buuut we will still change the format since we have to fix the css per page
   - navbar.hbs is empty pa rin iirc
4. i only mainly updated the index.js file
   - i placed a lot of comments inside
   - lets decide na lang sa gc how to go about the global variables & helpers situation
