    "Using a clean dish towel, grab each potato, and remove the skin from the potato. This will allow more steam to escape. Less steam means less moisture, and less moisture means lighter, fluffier gnocchi. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool for a few hours.",
    "Once they have cooled down, pass them through the fine holes of a cheese grater (for an easier and faster method use a potato ricer). Once the potatoes are grated down to fluffy little bits, place them onto a rimmed baking sheet and measure to 500 grams. Add one beaten egg yolk spread evenly across (1 beaten egg yolk for every 500 grams). Then sift 100 grams of all-purpose flour across the potatoes. ",
    "Bring the potatoes into a ball of dough using a bench scraper (or the desired tool) to chop and mix everything up to make sure the egg and flour are evenly distributed. Start using your hands to press it into one cohesive mass. ",
    "Once the mass has formed, start kneading for about 90 seconds for slightly toothsome gnocchi. A phrase to remember, \"The more you knead the tougher they'll bead, but if early on you surrender then they'll be tender\". ",
    "Once the dough is smooth and no egg or flour streaks remain, roll it out into a fat little log and cut it into four even pieces. Sift some all-purpose flour onto a work surface then roll each piece of dough into a 1\" thick rope. Press down any pudgy spots until it is nice and even. ",
    "Then using a bench scraper or sharp knife, cut into little dumplings or into the desired size. ",
    "For different shapes other than the pillow-like shape, roll a piece of dough between your hands until round or simply make a dent in the center using your finger. For a classic gnocchi shape, press down against the tines of a fork using your thumb down and across the fork. ",
    "Once all of the dough has been cut and shaped into the desired gnocchi shape, place onto a rimmed baking sheet and cover with a dusting of all-purpose flour. For non-immediate cooking, place in a freezer to solidify for 1 hour, then scrape off and place in a bag and back into the freezer. For immediate use, cook with one of the sauces below!"

    "There is very little bone between the breast and thigh so separating should be easy. To separate the drumstick, place shallow cuts around where the bones meet, then crack open and run the knife between to separate the drumstick from the thigh.",
    "Cut the chicken breasts in half. Rinse and repeat the steps on the other half of the chicken. You should have 10 pieces.",
    "Once the chicken has been cut into pieces, dry brine them by generously coating both sides with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.  Place into a food-safe container and cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in the fridge for at least 4 hours.",
    "Make the breading: combine 1 cup of whole milk with a few dashes of Louisiana hot sauce and 2 large eggs. Beat together with a fork until no streaks remain. For the dry ingredients, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, and a few tablespoons of the egg/milk mixture. This will create little chunks of breading which will help with crispiness.",
    "First, the chicken goes into the flour mixture, then into the egg mixture, and then back into the flour mixture. This is commonly known as double-dipped fried chicken. Repeat with the remaining chicken and let it hang out in the flour while you prepare oil for frying.",
    "In a high walled frying pan or skillet, place a big block of lard (about 1 cup) and 1 cup of vegetable oil. Heat over medium-high heat and bring it to 350Â°F.",
    "Gently lay the chicken pieces into the oil -making sure to place them going away from you to ensure no self-splattering. Fry for 5-7 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown and crisp.",
    "Place on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and keep in a 325Â°F oven until they are thoroughly cooked through.",
    "To prepare the spice mixture, in a small bowl goes 3 tablespoons of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of freshly ground pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder, paprika, and kosher salt. For a tame and less spicy version, you can reduce the cayenne pepper. Whisk to combine. Put the spice mix in a heat-proof bowl.",
    "Add 1/2 cup of the frying oil then mix completely together.",
    "Generously brush down both sides of the chicken with the spice oil. If applied while the oil and the chicken are still hot, it's going to absorb into the crust without making it soggy.",

    "Mix levain ingredients and rest in a warm area (70-80â) for 5 hours.",
    "One hour before your levain is done, mix together your bread flour and whole wheat flour. Add 580g of your water to the flour mixture (keeping 100g to the side for mixing later).",
    "Mix just until your dough comes together. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm area (same as your starter) for 1 hour.",
    "Mix your dough and levain together using a little of your separated water to help incorporate. Rest 20 minutes.",
    "Add your sea salt and the rest of your separated water and mix until incorporated. Slap and fold for 2-4 minutes or until your dough is smooth and begins to catch some air. Rest 15 minutes in the same warm area you placed your starter.",
    "Perform 6 sets of stretch and folds spaced out by 15 minutes for the first 3, then 30 minutes for the next 3. Make sure to place your dough back in the warm area for each rest. ",
    "Let your dough rest for a remainder of 1.5 hours, for a grand total of 4 hours.",
    "Dump out and divide your dough into 2 even pieces. Preshape each piece into a light boule and rest 5-10 minutes.",
    "Shape your dough into 2 batards and place into bannetons dusted with either rice flour or all purpose flour.",
    "Chill in the fridge overnight.",
    "Preheat a cast iron combo cooker in your oven from cold to 500â for 1 hour.",
    "Carefully place a dusted loaf into the hot pan, score the top, place the larger lid on top, and bake for 20 minutes.",
    "Remove the top from the combo cooker and lower the oven temperature to 450â. Bake for an additional 20-30 minutes, or until the loaf is deep brown.",
    "Remove and cool on a wire rack until room temperature. Repeat with the other loaf."
